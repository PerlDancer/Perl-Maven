The source code of http://perlmaven.com/
VERSION 0.11

Theoretically this code should be usable to run other sites
as well, but there are two main issues:

1) Probabaly there are number of assumptions specific to the Perl-Maven site.
   (These should be cleaned up, so if you encounter them, open a ticket)

2) The application is in flux. I might make some major changes to the file format
   or the configuration format as I try to make the site more generic. This,
   combined with a lack of test coverage might lead to some frustration.
   Even though if I change the file-format, I'll probably also write a converter
   as I'll need it too.

With that said, you are more than welcome to try the application, give feedback,
suggest bug fixes, features, changes etc.

Multilingual site
-----------------
The http://perlmaven.com/ site provides multi-lingual capabilities.
The default site on that URL is in English, but there are localized versions
of the site on URLs such as http://br.perlmaven.com/ http://cn.perlmaven.com/
http://he.perlmaven.com/


Adding a new language (site)
-----------------------------
* Get the language code from wikimedia
* Create the sites/CC/ from skeleton
* Add the language to sites.yml
* Add site to the  app.psgi and restart Starman on the server
* Updating the mymaven.yml configuration file is optional



TODO
-------
Clean up and move the TODO list to the GitHub issue system?

Change the password reminder (and the other administrative messages)
to either be just in plain text or include both HTML and plain text version.

Add Free, Pro, Perldoc tags automatically to pages
Add Audio, Video tags to pages where relevant.

Add some color mark to each entry in the archive and on the index page
  showing the tags:
      Interview, Pro, Free, Video, Audio, Perldoc
Create separate listing (probably paged) listing all the enties or only
one in a certain tag.

Add some mark to the user account when the user has purchased the pro account.
Send e-mail to the person when they bought one of the products
Change the system to let the user set the password after subscribing.

If I save all the meta information in one json file (or database), the following
operations are needed:
  list the most recent pages
     filtered by one or more tags
     filtered by a keyword
     filtered based on show mode (archive, index, feed ...)
     limited to N (or not limited), maybe paged
     sometimes include abstract, sometime not

Allow user to subscribe (by e-mail) to any combination of these:
  *) free articles
  *) interviews
  *) Pro articles
  Subscribe []
  Everything []
  Or select:
    Free:
    Pro:
    TV:
  In the database:
  news_all
  news_free
  news_pro
  news_tv


Feeds of any combination of these
  *) free articles
  *) interviews
  *) pro articles
  /atom  = everything
  /atom?free=1&pro=1&tv=1  = everything
  /tv/atom should redirect to /atom?tv=1
