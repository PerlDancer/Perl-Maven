- Create a Git repository for the unzipped sources
- A tool that can download a distribution, unzip it and add it to the repository
  that can check if the distribution we have is the latest or not,
  that can replace the current one with the latest version (remove old version, add new version)
- have an index file of what distributions we have
  If I am not mistaken this is basically a local, unzipped, partial CPAN.

- A tool that can convert the POD in the source files to HTML with the headers as the Perl 5 Maven site likes it.
  That can also create indexes from each distribution.
- Create a page for each distribution that allows for searching in the distribution.

- Create indexes that unite a number of distributions. For example Dancer and
  a number of Dancer plugins
  ot Perl::Critic and all (or most of) the Perl::Critic related distributions.
