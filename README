Add Free, Pro, Perldoc tags automatically to pages
Add Audio, Video tags to pages where relevant

Add some color mark to each entry in the archive and on the index page
  showing the tags:
      Interview, Pro, Free, Video, Audio, Perldoc
Create separate listing (probably paged) listing all the enties or only
one in a certain tag.




Add some mark to the user account when the user has purchased the pro account.
Send e-mail to the person when he bought one of the products
Change the system to let the user set the password after subscribing.

If I save all the meta information in one json file (or database), the following
operations are needed:
  list the most recent pages
     filtered by one or more tags
     filtered by a keyword
     filtered based on show mode (archive, index, feed ...)
     limited to N (or not limited), maybe paged
     sometimes include abstract, sometime not



Allow user to subscribe (by e-mail) to any combination of these:
  *) free articles
  *) interviews
  *) Pro articles
  Subscribe []
  Everything []
  Or select:
    Free:
    Pro:
    TV:
  In the database:
  news_all
  news_free
  news_pro
  news_tv


Feeds of any combination of these
  *) free articles
  *) interviews
  *) pro articles
  /atom  = everything
  /atom?free=1&pro=1&tv=1  = everything
  /tv/atom should redirect to /atom?tv=1


podfeed:
Philip Durbin
podcatcher http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_podcatchers
https://github.com/inoks/dropcast can make a feed. I subscribe to feeds in BeyondPod on Android.
You could make a feed for all of us to subscribe to the audio at http://huffduffer.com


- Create a Git repository for the unzipped sources
- A tool that can download a distribution, unzip it and add it to the repository
  that can check if the distribution we have is the latest or not,
  that can replace the current one with the latest version (remove old version, add new version)
- have an index file of what distributions we have
  If I am not mistaken this is basically a local, unzipped, partial CPAN.

- A tool that can convert the POD in the source files to HTML with the headers as the Perl 5 Maven site likes it.
  That can also create indexes from each distribution.
- Create a page for each distribution that allows for searching in the distribution.

- Create indexes that unite a number of distributions. For example Dancer and
  a number of Dancer plugins
  ot Perl::Critic and all (or most of) the Perl::Critic related distributions.
